### Challenge progress overview:
* User can create a new bank account
* User can deposit any sum
* User can withdraw any sum, funds-permitting
* User can view their statement in a user-friendly format
* The statement is reverse-ordered


## Specification

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. Bundle install
3. Launch irb
4. Once in irb, type in:
```
require './lib/bank_account'

account = BankAccount.new(Transaction.new, Statement.new)
```
5. You can then withdraw, deposit, and see your statement!
```
account.deposit(1000)
account.withdraw(500)
account.print_statement
```
## Testing
* I installed RSpec to test the programme, which included a feature test to test the overall functionality of the irb app.
* Rubocop to ensure good linting and only consistent code was created. This included the customisation of the Rubocop preferences so that it was fit for purpose.
* SimpleCov was used to safeguard against spiking and unsustainable code.

## Approach
* I began by dividing the responsibilities, and trying to understand how they could be spread across classes. I landed on 3 classes, one to handle transactions, Transaction, one to handle formatting of those transactions into a statement, Statement, and one to implement and execute the two previous classes, BankAccount.
